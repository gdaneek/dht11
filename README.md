# dht11
Library for working with the DHT11/DHT22 sensor

For any ATmega and ATtiny series microcontrollers

Takes up very little memory (less than 1KB)

Hardware: 

-> use one sensor per pin of the microcontroller

Software: 

-> use the include directive to connect the library

-> create an object of the dht11 class

-> use the begin() method with a parameter indicating the pin on which the sensor is located

-> use the getTemperature() method to get the temperature as a floating point number
